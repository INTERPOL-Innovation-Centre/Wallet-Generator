# Wallet-Generator
A Wallet Generator to be used on your own machine.

With this script on your own machine, you may generate the public/private key pair needed to establish your own Wallet.

This is a duplicate of the initial project formally hosted at https://github.com/MichaelMure/WalletGenerator.net.

Effectively, when WalletGenerator.net was found vulnerable and unsecure, with this version we are trying to create a secure version so you may securely create wallets for any of the 197 supported cryptocurrencies making sure nothing leaves you local machine.


- FOR NOW THIS IS IN BETA VERSION AND HAS NOT BEEN FULLY TESTED. USE AT YOUR OWN RISKS -

## Do not use the online version @ walletgenerator.net. At the time of writing this (12/03/2020), the website still presents suspicious code modifications. It uses the "coinImgUrl" variable for unecessary XHR requests and a "SecureRandomAdvanced" subroutine that has no good reasons to be used. More details here: [WalletGenerator.net disclosure](https://medium.com/mycrypto/disclosure-key-generation-vulnerability-found-on-walletgenerator-net-potentially-malicious-3d8936485961).

Another alternative (Bitcoin only) can be found at [bitaddress.org on Github](https://github.com/pointbiz/bitaddress.org)
