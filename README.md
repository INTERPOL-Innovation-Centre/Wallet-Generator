# WalletGenerator
A Wallet Generator to be used on your own machine.


With this script on your own machine, you may generate the public/private key pair needed to establish your own Wallet.

This is a duplicate of the initial project formally hosted at https://github.com/MichaelMure/WalletGenerator.net.

Effectively, when WalletGenerator.net was found vulnerable and unsecure, with this version we are trying to create a secure version so you may securely create wallets for any of the 197 supported cryptocurrencies making sure nothing leaves you local machine.


- FOR NOW THIS IS IN BETA VERSION AND HAS NOT BEEN FULLY TESTED. USE AT YOUR OWN RISKS -
