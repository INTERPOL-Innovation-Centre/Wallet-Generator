# WalletGenerator
A Wallet Generator to be used on your own machine.


With this script on your own machine, you may securely generate the public/private key pair needed to establish your own Wallet.

This is a duplicate the initial project formally hosted at https://github.com/MichaelMure/WalletGenerator.net.

Effectively, when WalletGenerator.net was found vulnerable and unsecure, we fixed it and now make it available again so you may securely create wallets for any of the 197 supported cryptocurrencies making sure nothing leaves you local machine.
